# [05AB1E](https://github.com/Adriandmen/05AB1E) is a concise, stack-based golfing language.

The expected `Hello, World!` program is `"Hello, World!"` (pushes the string `Hello, World!` to the stack and then implicitly outputs it). However, the trailing quote is optional, allowing for a more concise program `"Hello, World!`.

It seems that [somebody has found a more concise program than me](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/55422/hello-world/67457#67457), but it is not in any way readable.
